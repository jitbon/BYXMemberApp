# Group5

This repo is about building a web app for the BYX fraternity. The app will store members' information and allow officers to schedule events. 
We will use HTML and WebStorm for the front-end and mySQL for managing the database of fraternity members. We will use Python and Flask to implement the various functions in our program, and use Visual Studio for our programming environment. The members in our group are Jason Kim, Blaine Mitchell, Bo Peng, and Paul Woo.
