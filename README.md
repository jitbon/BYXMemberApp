# Project Information

This repo is about building a web app for the Vanderbilt chapter of the BYX fraternity. The app will store members' information and allow officers to schedule events. Our app will be secured by a login function, have a database for members and allow them to create accounts, distinguish roles for different positions, and have a scheduling function for planning events. We will use HTML and WebStorm for the front-end and mySQL for managing the database of fraternity members. We will use Python and Flask to implement the various functions in our program, and use Visual Studio for our programming environment. The members in our group are Jason Kim, Blaine Mitchell, Bo Peng, and Paul Woo, and this project is for CS4278- Principles of Operating Systems.
